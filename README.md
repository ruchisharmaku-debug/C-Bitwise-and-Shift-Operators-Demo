# C-Bitwise-and-Shift-Operators-Demo
This C++ program demonstrates the use of Bitwise Operators (&amp;, |, ^, ~), Shift Operators (&lt;&lt;, >>), and Increment/Decrement operators. It helps beginners understand how low-level operations work internally on binary values. Concepts covered: Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT Left Shift &amp; Right Shift Pre and Post Increment/Decrement Operator behavior
